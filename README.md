## What

A generic abstraction for building queries for arbitrary domain models that minimizes
magic strings, provides type safety, produces queries that read like a second grader wrote them,
and provides an easy interface to define new target query formats. All of that together means that 
when you choose to use these as your query builders you only need to write your queries once and 
use them anywhere. It's time that query mechanisms were based on your domain models instead of the 
data store.
